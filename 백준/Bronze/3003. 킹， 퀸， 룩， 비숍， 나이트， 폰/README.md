### 문제 설명

<p>Mirko has found an old chessboard and a set of pieces in his attic. Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces should contain: </p>

<ul>
	<li>One king </li>
	<li>One queen </li>
	<li>Two rooks </li>
	<li>Two bishops </li>
	<li>Two knights </li>
	<li>Eight pawns </li>
</ul>

<p>Mirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he should add or remove to make a valid set. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of 6 integers on a single line, each between 0 and 10 (inclusive). The numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output should consist of 6 integers on a single line; the number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces. </p>
