### 문제 설명

<p>In this problem you are given a number of sets of words. In each set, you are to determine which word comes first alphabetically. You should ignore case, so “apPle” will come before “Bat” but after “AnT”, for example.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each set starts with a single integer, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), which gives the number of words in the set. The next n lines contain one word(20) per line. A set will never contain two words that differ only in case. The last line of input will contain 0 on its own – this line should not be processed.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each set of words, output just the word that comes first alphabetically, on a line by itself, as it appears in the input.</p>
