### 문제 설명

<p>Not so long ago, before operating systems were as powerful as they are today, computers (which often had turbo buttons on the exterior) couldn't handle certain letters of the Croatian alphabet. Programmers agreed to use two or three-letter substitutions as in this table:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-center-20 td-center th-center">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Letter</th>
			<th> Characters </th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>č</td>
			<td>c=</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ć</td>
			<td>c-</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dž</td>
			<td>dz=</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>đ</td>
			<td>d-</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>lj</td>
			<td>lj</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>nj</td>
			<td>nj</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>š</td>
			<td>s=</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ž</td>
			<td>z=</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, the word ljes=njak consists of six letters in the Croatian alphabet: lj, e, š, nj, a, k. </p>

<p>Write a program that calculates the number of letters in the given word. </p>
